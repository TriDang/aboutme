        <div class="col-sm-4"><p>Last Friday, I had the opportunity to join the Industry Advisory Committees (IAC) meeting along with my colleagues. This meeting serves as a venue for open discussions between academics and industry experts about how to collaborate more effectively. In fact, there were suggestions from both sides on how to enhance student learning and better prepare them for the job market. Interestingly, the course that I've been coordinating at RMIT, Algorithms and Analysis, received much attention from the industry. One of the main reasons is that this course equips students with core knowledge and problem-solving skills that help them succeed not only in other courses but also in their future careers. I'm so happy to hear such positive feedback about my courses.

        <div class="col-sm-4"><p>The new semester started on March 4th. I've just returned to normal teaching after a semester free from teaching-related activities. For me, teaching is what I love most, even more than other academic activities such as research or industry engagement. This is purely a personal feeling, but I find teaching to be fun, motivating, and meaningful. Although I had no formal teaching activities last semester, it was a valuable period for reflection on my past efforts and how I can further improve my teaching.
