        <div class="col-sm-4"><p>On Tuesday, December 10, I was invited to participate in TestCon, the first industry conference for software testing in Vietnam. During the event, speakers covered a variety of topics, ranging from testing trends in 2025 to the use of large language models (LLMs) in test automation, and how academia and industry can collaborate to advance the field and enhance student career preparedness in software testing.</p>
        <p>I also had valuable discussions with industry professionals, which helped me build connections to potentially organize guest lectures on testing for RMIT students. These conversations also gave me new ideas on how to integrate software testing more effectively into my courses at RMIT.

My role was to deliver foundational AI knowledge and skills to primary, secondary, and high school teachers in Vietnam, aiming to enhance teaching and learning activities.</p>
        <p>The training sessions, held in Can Tho city on December 7 and 8, focused on key aspects of using AI in education, such as prompting techniques, preparing content, creating assessments, and developing interactive images and videos for lessons. The teachers greatly appreciated how these tools made their educational content more engaging and interactive.</p>
        <p>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to share my expertise in AI and contribute to the integration of technology in Vietnam's educational landscape, helping to improve teaching and learning experiences.

        <div class="col-sm-4"><p>Last Friday, I had the opportunity to join the Industry Advisory Committees (IAC) meeting along with my colleagues. This meeting serves as a venue for open discussions between academics and industry experts about how to collaborate more effectively. In fact, there were suggestions from both sides on how to enhance student learning and better prepare them for the job market. Interestingly, the course that I've been coordinating at RMIT, Algorithms and Analysis, received much attention from the industry. One of the main reasons is that this course equips students with core knowledge and problem-solving skills that help them succeed not only in other courses but also in their future careers. I'm so happy to hear such positive feedback about my courses.

        <div class="col-sm-4"><p>The new semester started on March 4th. I've just returned to normal teaching after a semester free from teaching-related activities. For me, teaching is what I love most, even more than other academic activities such as research or industry engagement. This is purely a personal feeling, but I find teaching to be fun, motivating, and meaningful. Although I had no formal teaching activities last semester, it was a valuable period for reflection on my past efforts and how I can further improve my teaching.
